# Python-Based Multi-Threaded Chat Application

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust, real-time chat system using Python's socket programming and threading capabilities. The system consists of a multi-threaded server that can handle multiple concurrent connections and two client implementations: a command-line interface (CLI) client and a graphical user interface (GUI) client with a modern, professional look.

## Key Features

- **Multi-threaded Server**: Handles multiple simultaneous client connections efficiently
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant message broadcasting to all connected clients
- **User Management**: Username support, online user tracking, and join/leave notifications
- **Professional GUI**: Modern dark-themed interface with color-coded messages and user list
- **Command-line Alternative**: Simple CLI client for lightweight usage or scripting
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Robust Error Handling**: Connection recovery, graceful disconnection, and error reporting

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.6+
- **Network Protocol**: TCP/IP using Python's socket library
- **Concurrency Model**: Multi-threading with thread safety
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter with ttk for modern styling
- **Code Organization**: Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns

## System Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Minimum Hardware**: 1GB RAM, 100MB free disk space
- **Required Python Packages**: 
  - tkinter (usually included with Python installation)
  - socket (standard library)
  - threading (standard library)

## Installation and Setup

No complex installation process is required. Simply download the project files to a directory of your choice.

### Dependencies

The project uses standard Python libraries, most of which are included in the default Python installation:

```bash
# If tkinter is not included in your Python installation:
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# For Red Hat/Fedora:
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# For macOS (using Homebrew):
brew install python-tk
```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the server:

```bash
python python_server.py
```

The server will start and listen for incoming connections on port 8888 (default).

### Connecting with the GUI Client

1. Open another terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the GUI client:

```bash
python improved_gui_client.py
```

4. Enter your username when prompted
5. Start chatting!

### Connecting with the CLI Client

If you prefer a simpler interface or need to run the client in a terminal-only environment:

```bash
python python_client.py
```

### Command-line Arguments (Optional)

Both clients support optional command-line arguments to specify the server IP and port:

```bash
python improved_gui_client.py --host 192.168.1.100 --port 7777
python python_client.py --host 192.168.1.100 --port 7777
```

## User Guide

### GUI Client

The GUI client offers a modern, intuitive interface:

1. **Connection**: The client automatically attempts to connect to the server when launched
2. **Username**: Enter your desired username when prompted
3. **Sending Messages**: Type in the input field at the bottom and press Enter or click Send
4. **Online Users**: View currently connected users in the left panel
5. **Disconnecting**: Close the window or type `/exit` to disconnect

### CLI Client

The command-line client offers these features:

1. **Connection**: The client connects to the server on startup
2. **Username**: Enter your username when prompted
3. **Sending Messages**: Type your message and press Enter
4. **Viewing Messages**: Messages from all users appear in the terminal
5. **Disconnecting**: Type `/exit` to disconnect from the server

## Architecture and Design

### Server Architecture

The server is built on a multi-threaded architecture:

1. **Main Thread**: Listens for new client connections
2. **Client Threads**: Each client connection is handled in a separate thread
3. **Shared State**: Thread-safe management of connected clients
4. **Message Broadcasting**: Each message is sent to all connected clients
5. **Error Handling**: Robust handling of disconnections and network errors

### Client Architecture

Both clients follow similar architecture with appropriate interfaces:

1. **Network Thread**: Handles incoming messages from the server
2. **Main Thread**: Manages the user interface and sends outgoing messages
3. **Message Queue**: Thread-safe message passing between network and UI threads
4. **UI Layer**: Either command-line or graphical interface

5. **Private Messaging**: Enable direct messages between users
6. **Emoji Support**: Add emoji selection and rendering
7. **Custom Theming**: Allow users to customize the interface
8. **WebSocket Interface**: Add browser-based client option
9. **Mobile Client**: Develop mobile application versions
10. **Notification System**: Add alerts for new messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Ensure the server is running
   - Check that the correct IP address and port are used
   - Verify that no firewall is blocking the connection

2. **GUI Client Display Issues**
   - Update to the latest Python version
   - Ensure Tkinter is properly installed
   - Try adjusting your display scaling settings

3. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check if the port is already in use
   - Verify you have permission to bind to the port
   - Ensure your Python version is 3.6 or higher

4. **Message Delay**
   - Check your network connection
   - Reduce the number of connected clients
   - Consider running the server on a more powerful machine

### Debug Tips

- Check terminal output for error messages
- Enable verbose logging by modifying the print statements
- Test with the CLI client to isolate GUI-specific issues
- Try connecting to localhost to eliminate network issues

## Conclusion

This Python-based chat application provides a solid foundation for real-time text communication. It demonstrates important concepts in network programming, concurrency, and user interface design while remaining accessible and easy to use. The system can be run as-is for simple chat needs or extended to create more sophisticated communication platforms.
